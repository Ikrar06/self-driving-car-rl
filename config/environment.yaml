# Environment Configuration

# Window settings
window:
  width: 1000
  height: 700

# Car physics (optimized for learning)
car:
  width: 20  # Smaller car for easier maneuvering
  height: 15  # Smaller car
  max_velocity: 4.0  # Slower for better control
  min_velocity: -1.0  # Slower reverse
  acceleration: 0.2  # Gentler acceleration
  friction: 0.94  # More friction for better control
  turn_rate: 0.12  # Faster turning to navigate tight spaces

# Sensors
sensors:
  num_sensors: 5
  angles: [-60, -30, 0, 30, 60]  # degrees relative to car heading
  max_range: 200  # pixels
  render_rays: true

# Rewards (optimized for learning - BALANCED!)
rewards:
  survival: 10.0  # Increased from 1.0 to balance penalties
  checkpoint: 200.0  # Increased from 100.0 - BIG reward for progress!
  crash: -50.0  # Increased penalty for crash
  # Reward shaping now handled in simulation.py:
  # - Wall proximity penalty (BALANCED - not too extreme)
  # - Red sensor turning rewards (clear but proportional)
  # - Center of track bonus
  # - Speed bonus (only when safe)
  # - Distance traveled reward
